# VideoGameStore

<a name="readme-top"></a>

This is a ASP.NET MVC project designed to perform the fuctionality of a video game store. I created this as a way to improve my coding skills while applying for jobs. All functionality can be performed via the front end or by JWT verified API CRUD operations. This is a work in progress and not intended to be used in a production enviroment.
